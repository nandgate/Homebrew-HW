Programmable Logic Device files for the Homebrew project.

All of the PLD devices (AFT22V10 & ATF16V8) are programmed using the Atmel version of WinCUPL.
WinCUPL can be downloaded from https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/spld-cplds/pld-design-resources

Each directory is a project for a board.
